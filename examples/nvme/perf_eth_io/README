example command:
./examples/nvme/perf/perf_eth_io -q 128 -s 1024 -w write -t 10 -c 0xF -o 4096 -r 'trtype:PCIe traddr:0000:01:00.0'

This will write packets from the network (dpdk port 0) to nvme for 60 seconds. After this it reads them from nvme
drive and push them our of the network interface.

Limitations:
- coremask should be consequent cores starting core 0
- -w parameter though requried but is not used. App operates as following - first write to nvme then read from nvme
- The threads start execution (and time slot starts) only when first packet is received. First packet does not gets
  written into the driver (as it is only PoC).
- Packets are expected to be continuously sent to all the cores with distribution. Packets are processed in burst
  of 128 and will get stuck in permenent loop (to receive packets) if packets are not sent.
